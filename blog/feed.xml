&lt;p&gt;As a teen on the internet, its unforgiving permanent nature is genuinely scary. I’ve made my fair share of &lt;strong&gt;embarrassing&lt;/strong&gt; posts, and I’ve been fortunate to have no one see them where a future version of me can shred their existence. However, I feel envious and fearful viewing the carefreeness of others in managing their personas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of self-consciousness in my online personas makes managing the ones I use especially tense. It’s hard to separate yourself into unique masks and leave no trace of the previous one you were wearing. This idea of the &lt;em&gt;permanence in this identity&lt;/em&gt; colours this presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By my full admission, Protoconal is a public-facing professional identity. Being a person with a disparate lump of abandoned and active accounts and handles makes the interplay of changing between disguises online challenging. So, in designing a cohesive professional identity in a world dominated by the requirement of an online presence, I have been forced to expose my real identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the birth of this new identity is tied to my reality, the threat of someone uniting all the parts of my digital footprint is extra stressful. I hope the day never comes when a potential employer finds out that I enjoy reading romance novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or worse, my art Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’d say I’ve done a pretty good job at being barren on the internet, though you can tie me together. &lt;strong&gt;{I AM NOT CHALLENGING YOU.}&lt;/strong&gt; It’s also awkward to share some of my interests.)&lt;/p&gt;
